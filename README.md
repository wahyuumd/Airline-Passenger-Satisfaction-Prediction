# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict airline passenger satisfaction based on various factors related to their travel experience. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing features such as in-flight services, online booking, seat comfort, and delays, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately classifies passenger satisfaction. This model will help airlines identify areas of improvement to enhance customer experience and loyalty.

## Objectives
Key objectives include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that significantly impact passenger satisfaction.
- **Model Training**: Employing various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to train predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC to select the best model.
- **Deployment**: Saving the selected model for deployment in live applications to support real-time decision-making by the airline.
